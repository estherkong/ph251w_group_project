## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

Pam

summary(sim_novelid_CA\$new_unrecovered)

```{r}

# We can assume that the data source is simulated data of infectious disease cases for each county in California reported from public health agencies and organizations such as county health departments during 2023. 

# Our research question explores if the current outbreak is disproportionately affecting certain demographic or geographic populations to inform departments and agencies how to allocate prevention and treatment resources. 

library(readr)

sim_novelid_CA <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com//PHW290/phw251_projectdata/main/scenario_1/sim_novelid_CA.csv")

sim_novelid_CA

unique(sim_novelid_CA$dt_diagnosis)

#Our importing process involves using the proper package to use a function that imports CSV files and locating the file path (or link) of the file on GITHUB.

#Geography
class(sim_novelid_CA$county)
unique(sim_novelid_CA$county)

#Demographics
class(sim_novelid_CA$age_cat)
unique(sim_novelid_CA$age_cat)
class(sim_novelid_CA$sex)
class(sim_novelid_CA$race_ethnicity)
range(sim_novelid_CA$race_ethnicity)
#1 = "White, Non-Hispanic", 2 = "Black, Non-Hispanic", 3 = "American Indian or Alaska Native, Non-Hispanic", 4 = "Asian, Non-Hispanic", 5 = "Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, Non-Hispanic", 6 = "Multiracial (two or more of above races), Non-Hispanic", 7 = "Hispanic (any race)", 9 = "Unknown). No Unknowns then. 

class(sim_novelid_CA$dt_diagnosis)

class(sim_novelid_CA$time_int)
summary(sim_novelid_CA$time_int)

class(sim_novelid_CA$new_infections)
summary(sim_novelid_CA$new_infections)
class(sim_novelid_CA$cumulative_infected)
summary(sim_novelid_CA$cumulative_infected)

#Newly identified individuals having severe disease requiring hospitalization
class(sim_novelid_CA$new_severe)
summary(sim_novelid_CA$new_infections)

#Cumulative number of identified individuals having severe disease requiring hospitalization
class(sim_novelid_CA$cumulative_severe)
summary(sim_novelid_CA$cumulative_severe)

# We might need to convert county, age_cat, sex, race_ethnicity from character into something else if we are going to do a regression later, for example, to compare them with new_infections, cumulative_infected, etc. I am not sure about this one. 

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r Esther's chunk'}
library(tidyverse)

filepath_ca_pop_2023 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com//PHW290/phw251_projectdata/main/scenario_1/ca_pop_2023.csv"

ca_pop_2023 <- read_csv(filepath_ca_pop_2023)

head(ca_pop_2023)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

### Carli

```{r}

novelid_LAcounty <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com//PHW290/phw251_projectdata/main/scenario_1/sim_novelid_LACounty.csv")

novelid_LAcounty

la_county_cases <- novelid_LAcounty
names(la_county_cases) <- tolower(names(la_county_cases))

names(la_county_cases)
```
